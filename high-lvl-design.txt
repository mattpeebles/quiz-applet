High Level Design Quiz Applet

Actual Requirements

1. Users start on screen where they can click a button to start quiz
        -research how to have a home screen with a button that initiates the quiz that doesn't require an additional webpage - mostly done. seperate into sections, and either replace class or replace section with new html called from a render function.
	-a variable that includes html for start button

2. 10 MC questions, one displayed each time
        -a question object with a question, right answer, and answers keys
        -renders only one question at a time by using a for loop through the object
        -will need a render function that places the object index in an html form with a required class
	-research how to crossreference the answer key when user selects a radio button
	-research other ways to generete multiple choice questions without using radio buttons that still allows required tags to be placed in them
	-research how to increment a for loop once per button click. i.e. increment i 1 time each time the next question is submitted	
	-at least one variable that includes html for the question
	-research how to take an object and push each key value to a seperate line of html. for instance. have question.answers[0] to radio 1, questoins.answers[1] to radio 2 and so forth. perhaps have within the html variable an incrementer that shows object.key[0] object.key[2] within the html.

3. has a submit/next button that takes user to next question after they answer the current question
	-research to see how to craft a render function that calls on the question object

4. unable to skip questions
	-research to see if a required class can be added to MC form question. if not research a similar functionality

5. each question should be numbered so users know where they are e.g. 7 out of 10
	-this could be labeled in the object within the key section
	-alternatively could be an array of it's own that is looped simulataenously with the questions object
	
		
6. users should be able to always see their updated score
        a. e.g. 7 correct, 1 incorrect
                -stable object that has correct and incorrect keys with appropriate values
		-values would be updated depeneding on their answer
		-perhaps an if then loop that focuses on the correct answer and else adds 1 to the incorrect value

7. users should recieve immediate feedback on their answer
	-perhaps have an alert that lets them know they had an incorrect answer and shows the right answer
	-perhaps have a toggle class function that adds a green box around the correct answer and red box around the selected answer if incorrect - would need an if then statement that calls on the object
        a. is it correct/incorrect
        b. if incorrect - correct answer is shown

8. after quiz is complete, users should see final score and be able to start a new game.
	-render the score object on final screen and remove all quiz questions
	-research how to also rerender the start button as we did in the beginning of the game
		a. maybe it loops back to the beginning and shows the home screen again, so astart over button rather than a re-take quiz button
		b. or a button that immediately allows you to start at question one.
	-probably can duplicate the html that is used for the opening screen, just loop back to it and replace the text with score and retake quiz

Thinkful Additional Requirements
-use objects
-use arrays
-use functions
-use loops
-use event listeners
-traverse the DOM
-manipulate the DOM

Logical Chunks
-home screen
	solution: unsure
	implementation: unsure
		- need to do research on where to place the classes for title, 			either on section or on the div to implement correctly


-questions
	solution: object with questions, answer, and answer choices
	implementation: unsure - requires render function, question var, maybe state var, for loop that loops through object - needs research

-user location
	solution: unsure
	implementtation: unsure

-user score
	solution: unsure
	implementation: unsure

-end screen
	solution: unsure

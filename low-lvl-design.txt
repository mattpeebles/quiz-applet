Home Screen Implementation
	title  first load has distinct class to make it quite big and centered on page. This is contained within a section.
	start button is located within a div that is within a container.The div with class js-object-dispaly will be replaced by the render functiont as the quiz moves forth i.e. that is replaced with rendered object once it is button is clicked either start, next question, or retake
	title classes are then toggled to essentially be a nav bar and remove original class to be displayed throughout the quiz

	on load title is contained with a section with classes title, first-load-title
	a seperate section is created that has class container which will hold the start button plus questions object and finally end screen, this will be the container that will have the div with class js-object-display that has the replaceWith() function appended to it in all the render functions. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
